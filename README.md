Description:

The AI-Based Recommendation System is a Java application designed to suggest relevant products or content to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system uses a collaborative filtering approach, where recommendations are generated by analyzing the similarities between different users and the items they interact with. If two users have shown interest in similar items, the system assumes that they may also like each other’s remaining items. Based on this logic, the program identifies items that a target user has not yet used and recommends them as potential choices.

This project demonstrates the basic principles behind popular recommendation engines used in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and social media applications. It highlights important artificial intelligence concepts such as pattern recognition, user similarity, and preference prediction. The implementation uses data structures like HashMaps and Lists to efficiently store user–item relationships, and set operations to avoid duplicate recommendations.

The system is simple, lightweight, and easy to extend. Additional AI features such as rating-based similarity scoring, weighted recommendations, sorting by relevance, and real-time learning can be added in the future. Overall, this project helps students understand how AI enhances user experience by delivering personalized content, and provides hands-on experience in applying Java programming to real-world intelligent systems
